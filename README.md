# LINQPad ➡️ .NET Interactive
Convert .linq to .ipynb so that you can run your [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) scripts in VSCode

This is currently in the "Proof of concept" stage

# Usage
(Create .ipynb file)

Cell 1
```
#i "C:\Users\amb12\source\repos\ambrose-leung\build\nupkg" //if building locally
#r "nuget:Ambrose.Linqpad.Convert.KernelExt"
```

Cell 2
```
#!convert2ipynb "C:\path\to\linqpadscript.linq"
```

# Ideal User Experience
User installs VS Code extension, opens .linq file, chooses command to convert (Ctrl+Shift+P), New .ipynb is generated and opened in VS Code.

# Current User Experience
User creates .ipynb and runs 2 cells of C# code, one requires the path to the .linq file to be entered manually.  New .ipynb is generated and opened in VS Code (on Windows).

# Technical
- Uses [`Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.Documents`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.Documents/) nuget to create .ipynb
- Will use [`Chino.Jupyter.Extensions`](https://github.com/roberchi/Chino.Jupyter.Extensions) to implement `#load` functionality
- Logic for conversion is packaged as a .NET library
- Implements IKernelExtension to expose the magic command #!convert2ipynb
